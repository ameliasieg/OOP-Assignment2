Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming I (a.k.a. Object-Oriented Programming)- Programming Assignment 2

This program creates a turn-based game that expands on the idea of 2D movement. At the beginning of each game, four blobs are placed at random positions within a 10 x 10 square grid. Each player is represented by a team of four blobs and the driver goes back and forth between those players. Players are asked whether they would like to attack or move their blob.
